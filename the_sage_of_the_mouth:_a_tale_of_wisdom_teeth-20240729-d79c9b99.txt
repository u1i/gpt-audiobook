Once upon a time, in a world parallel to our own, a strange phenomenon occurred. Wisdom teeth, those pesky molars at the back of the mouth, started to gain sentience. No longer were they simply tools for chewing; they became founts of wisdom, dispensing advice to their owners.    Our story begins with a young man named Rory. One day, Rory started to feel an odd sensation in his mouth. It wasn't pain, exactly, but a kind of tingling and vibrating that seemed to be centered around his wisdom teeth. Then, to his absolute shock, he heard a voice. It was soft and muffled, but unmistakably there. It took a moment for Rory to realize that the advice was coming from his own mouth.    'Rory,' his wisdom teeth whispered. 'Remember to floss daily. And while you're at it, don't forget the importance of humility and patience.'    Rory was stunned. His wisdom teeth were not just sentient, but they were giving him advice. And surprisingly, it wasn't just about dental hygiene. They offered wisdom on life, love, and everything in between.    As word spread about Rory's sentient wisdom teeth, people were both intrigued and horrified. Some couldn't comprehend it, while others saw it as a miracle. Rory, however, took it in stride. He saw the wisdom his teeth offered as a gift. He became a better person, kinder, more patient, humbler, and yes, he even started to floss every day.    Over time, Rory's wisdom teeth became famous. People from all walks of life sought advice from them. And to each, the teeth offered nuggets of wisdom. Some were simple, like reminding people to brush twice a day. Others were profound, advising on matters of the heart and soul.    Rory's life took a turn he never anticipated, all thanks to his sentient wisdom teeth. They not only guided him but also helped countless others. And so, they remained, the sage of the mouth, a symbol of wisdom in the most unlikely of places.
