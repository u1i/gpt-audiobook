In a far-off galaxy, where nebulae reflected off the chrome hulls of interstellar cruisers, lived an interstellar insurance agent named Orion. His job was to adjust claims on various space calamities, a role both intriguing and challenging in its own right. His office, located on the floating metropolis of Andromeda, witnessed a constant influx of clients, each with their unique tales of galactic mishaps.Orion was a humanoid with a keen sense of justice and a profound understanding of the interstellar laws. His job took him through a whirlwind of adventures, from the asteroid fields of Sirius B, where a cargo ship had met with an unfortunate collision, to the mysterious black holes on the fringe of the galaxy where an explorer's ship had simply vanished.One day Orion received a case that was stranger than usual. A claim had come in from Captain Zephyr whose spaceship, The Nebula Drifter, had been damaged in a supernova explosion. The Captain claimed that the star's explosion was sudden and uncharted. Orion, intrigued and suspicious, decided to investigate personally.He hitched a ride on The Centaur, a fast scout ship, and zoomed off towards the remnants of the supernova. It was a sight to behold, the death of a star illuminating the vast, cold darkness of space. Orion, along with his pilot, began to inspect the Drifter's flight records and the stellar map. After hours of investigation, a pattern started to emerge.Orion discovered that the star's explosion was not sudden but had been predicted by the Galactic Observatory years ago. It turned out Captain Zephyr had ignored the interstellar warnings and flown dangerously close to the dying star, hoping to gather rare star fragments. Orion concluded that Zephyr's negligence was the cause of the calamity.Returning to his office on Andromeda, Orion denied the claim, stating the Captain's recklessness as the reason. He took it as a lesson to remind all spacefarers of the importance of heeding stellar warnings. The case of the Nebula Drifter became a precedent in interstellar insurance claims, setting a clear distinction between genuine mishaps and preventable calamities.Thus, Orion continued his work, ensuring fairness in a universe known for its unpredictability. The job of an interstellar insurance agent was never easy, but Orion tackled every claim with determination and a sense of justice, making the cosmos a little more predictable for those who dared to explore it.
