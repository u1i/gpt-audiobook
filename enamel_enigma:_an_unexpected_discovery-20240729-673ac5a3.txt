In the heart of the bustling city of New York, a young, aspiring dentist named Ethan stumbled upon a mystical portal leading to a world he never knew existed - the tooth fairy's black market.Ethan, a recent graduate from the prestigious NYU College of Dentistry, was known for his obsession with teeth. One day, while examining an oddly shaped milk tooth, he noticed a faint, otherworldly glow emanating from it. The tooth, a parting gift from his last patient, led him to an antique, ornate mirror in his basement, which served as a portal to a peculiar realm.Stepping into the mirror, Ethan found himself in a bustling, luminescent marketplace, filled with hundreds of fairies trading teeth of all shapes and sizes. He soon understood this was no ordinary marketplace; it was a black market run by the tooth fairies. Teeth were being traded for magical potions, ancient scrolls, and mystical items that Ethan couldn't even begin to comprehend. He was fascinated yet terrified. He'd heard of the tooth fairy from childhood tales, but a black market run by these fairies was beyond his wildest imaginations. He saw teeth of extraordinary sizes and shapes, some glowing like the moon, while others as dark as the night sky. Ethan's dental instincts kicked in. He began to examine the teeth, using his dental tools that he had instinctively brought along. He noticed the magical properties of these teeth. Some had the power to heal, some to destruct, while others had the ability to manipulate time. Suddenly, he was caught in the act by the head of the tooth fairies. Aghast at a human's presence, she was about to cast a forgetting spell when Ethan made a bold proposal. He offered to use his dental expertise to check the value and authenticity of teeth in exchange for his memory.Intrigued, the head fairy agreed, and thus began Ethan's double life. During the day, he was a mild-mannered dentist in New York, and at night, he became the official tooth inspector of the tooth fairy's black market.His intrepid journey, however, was just beginning. He would soon unravel the dark secrets of this black market and the real price the fairies had to pay for their magic. His journey would force him to question his morals, challenge his dental oath, and confront a realm far beyond human comprehension.
