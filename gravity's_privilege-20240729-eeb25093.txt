In a future not too far away, humanity had to adapt to a reality where Earth's gravity is no longer a universal constant but a tradable commodity. This was the era after the Gravity Alteration (GA) technology was invented. The device that could control gravity was a luxury only the wealthy could afford. The elite, the one percent, they could walk firmly on the ground while the rest of the population floated aimlessly, tethered to their homes, their work, their world.The protagonist, a young woman named Eva, was born into a world where her feet never touched the ground. She was one of the Floaters, the majority of the population who couldn't afford gravity. Their lives were spent in a perpetual state of floatation, tied down by ropes and weights, always dreaming of the day they could feel the solid ground beneath their feet.Eva's father used to tell her stories about the time when everyone could walk, run, and jump. He told her about the sensation of rain falling straight down, how it felt to jump into a pile of leaves, the pleasure of a simple walk in the park. To Eva, these were fairy tales, beautiful but distant.Yet, Eva was a fighter. She was not content with the status quo. Using scrap materials she found floating around, she began to build her own GA device. It was a painstaking process, full of trials and errors, but she was determined.One day, after countless failures, her device flickered to life. She felt the unfamiliar pull, her feet touching the ground for the first time. It was everything she had imagined and more. The feeling of the cold, hard floor beneath her feet, the stability, the certainty, it was exhilarating. She had done it.News of Eva's achievement spread quickly. The Floaters saw hope for the first time. The wealthy, fearing their exclusive privilege was at risk, sought to take Eva's invention for themselves. But Eva was ready. She had prepared for this. She had made multiple devices, spreading them among the Floaters. A revolution was sparked. The Floaters, now grounded, fought back against the repression. A new era dawned on humanity, where gravity was no longer a luxury but a right for all. Eva's tale became a legend, an inspiration for everyone that the natural laws of the world should be a birthright, not a privilege.
