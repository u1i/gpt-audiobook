In the world I know, people age as they should - day by day, year by year, but only in the reality they live in. The images frozen in the photographs they are in, age backwards. It's not just an odd occurrence, it's a mystical phenomenon that's been a part of our lives since the invention of photography.     I remember my first picture, taken on my fifth birthday. I was grinning ear to ear, my eyes sparkling with the anticipation of opening presents. Now, that photograph shows a baby, barely a year old, with the same spark in his eyes, and a toothless grin.     As the years passed, my photographs became my mirrors - reflecting not my present, but my past in reverse. My high school graduation photo now shows a toddler, barely able to walk. My wedding photo, once filled with love and laughter, now shows a young boy and girl, holding hands at their first day of school.    The phenomenon is bittersweet; we age in reality, but our photographs age in reverse. We get to relive our memories, but only in reverse. The joy is in knowing that as we grow older, our photographs become younger, preserving the most innocent versions of us.    It's a constant reminder that no matter how old we get, we always have our younger selves within us. It's a paradox of aging - the body ages forward, the soul ages backward.    But it's not just about getting old or young. It's about the journey, the transition that comes with age. It's about seeing your life unfold in reverse in your photographs, while you move forward in reality. It's about cherishing the past, the present, and the future all at once.     So here I am, an old man in reality, a newborn in my photos. And I can't help but marvel at the beauty of it all - the cycle of life, the passage of time, the magic of aging - forward in life, backward in photos.
